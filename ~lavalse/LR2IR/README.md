LR2IR mimicked Server
=====================

by kuna

* CAUTION
---------------------

This server code is JUST FOR FUN.

Do not use this for commercial.

* MUST READ THIS
---------------------

1. *.cgi is NOT cgi code. it's php code, so you should change extension or httpd.conf in apache.
2. you have to create Tables in db 'LR2IR', using _dbSetup.php. but before execution, you have to config MySQL setting in "./2/mysqlinfo.php".
3. this code is based in UTF-8, different from original (Shift_JIS)

* NOT IMPLEMENTED
---------------------
1. Some unknown systems (ex: rseed, ghost, etc)
2. Unstable DB system
3. Better UI
